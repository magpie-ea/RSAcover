# General Changes from Pilot 1

1. Fix a bug causing overlapping shapes
2. Use *shape* as the referreing noun in Xs and color conjunctions, instead of *object*.
3. add more filler items such that number of filler and experimental items are equal
4. In the condition *random*, shapes are randomly generated across the full screnn, instead of only in the two pre-divided regions.  
5. Random number of shapes are reduced to between 3 and 5. (was before between 4 and 8).
6. Remove the predicate "grouped" and only keep "separeted.".
7. Adjust the logic of -filler to make sure this can serve as a control condition.
8. Change initial to 50.
